abstract = {Purpose
Although many youth consider suicide, only a subset act on suicidal thoughts and attempt suicide. The objective of this study was to identify patterns of risk factors that differentiate adolescents who experienced suicidal thoughts from those who attempted suicide.
Methods
This study analyzed data from the 2013, 2015, and 2017 National Youth Risk Behavior Surveys. Classification tree analysis was used to identify combinations of health risk behaviors and demographic factors that improved the identification of past-year suicide attempts among adolescents with past-year suicide ideation or planning (overall n = 7,493).
Results
Forty percent of the past-year ideators attempted suicide in the same period. The best-performing tree included three variables and defined four subgroups. Youth characterized by heroin use and past-year physical fights were at a strikingly high risk of being attempters (78%). Youth who had experienced rape were also likely to be attempters (58%), whereas those who had endorsed none of these three variables were relatively less likely to be attempters (29%). Overall, the tree’s classification accuracy was modest (area under the curve = .65).
Conclusions
This study advances previous research by identifying notable constellations of risk behaviors that accounted for adolescents’ transition from suicidal ideation to behavior. However, even with many health risk behavior variables, a large sample, and a multidimensional analytic approach, the overall classification of suicide attempters among ideators was limited. Implications for future research are discussed.}

abstract = {Abstract Background Concussions are associated with a variety of physical, cognitive, and mental health impairments. If sustained during adolescence, a time when the brain is undergoing development, the risk of long-term impairments becomes heightened. This is a notable subject for investigation as many concussions are sustained among adolescents during high school sports and other physical activities. Methods We used data from the 2019 United States Youth Risk Behavior Survey to investigate the association between concussions and suicidality (i.e., suicide ideation, planning, and attempts), suicide capability (i.e., physical fighting and weapon carrying), and hopelessness, a risk factor for suicide. We utilized a cross-sectional design and used multivariate regression models and t tests for analysis. Results Participants were 1754 adolescent students who sustained a concussion during the prior year (54.61\% male; M age = 15.94) and 9795 adolescent students who did not sustain a concussion during the prior year (47.27\% male; M age = 15.95). Females were less likely (13.23\%) than males (17.12\%) to report at least one concussion in the past 12 months. Both male and female students who had experienced a concussion were more likely to report physical fighting, weapon carrying, and hopelessness. Male students with a concussion history were also more likely to report suicide attempts than male students without a concussion history. Conclusion Findings indicate that concussions are associated with an increased risk of suicide attempts, suicide capability, and hopelessness among male adolescents and suicide capability and hopelessness among female adolescents. They further suggest a need for additional mental health support and safety policies for student-athletes and other at-risk adolescents.},

   abstract = {Sexual violence and physical fighting are independent risk factors for suicidal behaviors among adolescents. However, whether the concurrence of these two risk factors increases the risk of suicidal behaviors among ideators, and by how much that risk increases are unknown. This study analyzed data from the 2019 National Youth Risk Behavior Surveys. Students who reported having seriously considered attempting suicide in the past year were included (n = 1755). The associations between physical fighting/sexual violence status and the risk of suicide attempt/plan/attempt requiring medical intervention were estimated. The concurrence of physical fighting and sexual violence substantially increased the relative risk of attempted suicide (adjusted relative risk, adRR = 1.99, 95% CI 1.72, 2.29) and attempted suicide requiring medical intervention (adRR = 4.07, 95% CI 2.84, 5.85; subgroup analyses: among women, adRR = 3.33, 95% CI 2.14, 5.17; among men, adRR = 6.25, 95% CI 3.32, 12.28). Among students who had experienced concurrent physical fighting and sexual violence, more suicide-attempt-associated health-risk behaviors were reported by men (median = 14) than women (median = 12) (p = 0.0023). The concurrence of physical fighting and sexual violence among adolescent suicide ideators was shown to be significantly associated with an increased risk of attempted suicide. A wide variety of health-risk behaviors were shown to cluster with the concurrence of physical fighting and sexual violence. This was especially the case among men, consistent with their higher rate of attempted suicide requiring medical intervention.},

Multinomial logistic regression was used to examine the co-occurring association of marijuana use and prescription opioid misuse with multiple suicide attempts. Of the 2,562 adolescents who experienced suicidal ideation, 19.2 % also attempted suicide multiple times during the past year and 19.0 % reported ever using marijuana and misusing prescription opioids, 8.8 % misused prescription opioids only, and 33.3 % used marijuana only. In the multivariate model, for adolescents who used marijuana and misused prescription opioid, the risk of attempting suicide once was 1.77 times higher (RRR = 1.77, 95 % CI = 1.22–2.59) and the risk of multiple suicide attempts was 3.23 times higher (RRR = 3.23, 95 % CI = 1.95–5.33) when compared to adolescents who had never used marijuana nor misused prescription opioid. The risk of multiple suicide attempts was greater for bisexual and racial/ethnic minority adolescents and adolescents who felt sad or hopeless. Interventions that prevent prescription opioid misuse among adolescents may be effective in mitigating suicide attempts.}

ABSTRACT={Purpose: Suicide is the second leading cause of death among high school aged students in the United States. Significant risk factors for suicidal behaviors among youth include diagnoses of depression or other mental illnesses. The association between self-reported sad feelings and suicidal behaviors has been understudied in the literature among United States high school students.Methods: The 2019 National Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) school-based questionnaire, coordinated by the CDC, captured a nationally-representative sample (N = 13,677) of students' responses to health-related behaviors. National sex-stratified prevalences of sad feelings and suicidal behaviors were calculated. Adjusted weighted logistic regression was used to examine the association between self-reported sad feelings and suicidal behaviors.Results: Out of 13,677 high-school students, 35.8% of students self-reported sad feelings. Suicidal behaviors in the overall sample included 18.2% had seriously considered suicide, 15.2% made a plan on how they would attempt suicide, and 7.3% attempted suicide within the past 12 months. There was an 8–11-fold increased odds of all suicidal behaviors among those who reported sad feelings among both females and males.Conclusions: This study reveals a remarkably high prevalence of sad feelings among US youth, and underscores a significant association between self-reported sad feelings and suicidal behaviors among this population. The YRBS survey, routinely administered across US high school students, should be better leveraged to target interventions toward these high-risk youth in order to decrease the significant burden of suicidal behaviors among adolescents.}

   abstract = {PURPOSE: The current study examines the associations between a range of risk factors and reports of suicide attempts and attempts requiring medical care in a nationally representative study of high school students. The goal is to examine sex differences in the risk factors associated with suicide attempts and attempt-related injuries requiring treatment by a health-care provider. METHODS: We used data from the 2007 Youth Risk Behavior Survey for students in grades 9-12 to assess the prevalence and risk factors for suicidal behavior, as well as differences in these for boys and girls. Cross-sectional multivariate logistic regression analyses were computed to determine the most important risk factors for suicide attempts and for suicide attempts requiring medical care for the sample overall and also stratified for boys and for girls. RESULTS: Overall, 6.9% of adolescents attempted suicide (9.3% of girls versus 4.6% of boys). Girls were more likely than boys to report a suicide attempt in the past year (Adj.OR=2.89). Among girls, sadness (Adj.OR=5.74), weapon carrying (Adj.OR=1.48), dating violence (Adj.OR=1.60), forced sex (Adj.OR=1.72), and huffing glue (Adj.OR=2.04) were significantly associated with suicide attempts. Among boys, sadness (Adj.OR=10.96), weapon carrying (Adj.OR=1.66), forced sex (Adj.OR=2.60), huffing glue (OR=1.63), hard drug use (Adj.OR=2.18), and sports involvement (Adj.OR=1.52) were significantly associated with suicide attempts. CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate similarities and differences in the modifiable risk factors that increase risk for suicide attempts among boys and girls. In terms of the differences between boys and girls, hard drug use and sports involvement may be important factors for suicide-prevention strategies directed specifically towards boys, while dating violence victimization may be an important risk factor to address for girls. Overall, these findings can help guide prevention, clinical practice, and intervention strategies to prevent suicidal behaviors among adolescents.},

About one in ten adolescents (15.5% of females versus 3.6% of males) experienced sexual violence. Controlling for other factors, the odds of reporting suicidal ideation were 1.86 times higher for females who experienced sexual violence (AOR=1.86, 95% CI=1.44–2.42) when compared to their non-victimized counterparts. Females who experienced sexual violence had almost double the odds of making a suicide attempt (AOR=1.94, 95% CI=1.43–2.65) whereas males who experienced sexual violence had more than threefold higher odds of making a suicide attempt (AOR=3.32, 95% CI=2.17–5.08). Understanding the association between sexual violence victimization and suicidal behaviors could contribute to early identification of adolescents who may be at risk of engaging in suicidal behaviors.}

A hypothesized path model was fit to data from the 2011 Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) on a nationally representative sample of 15,425 high-school students from across the United States. Results suggested that the effects of traditional and cyberbullying victimization on suicidal thinking, suicide planning, and suicide attempts were mediated by violent behavior, substance abuse, and depression. Results also suggested reciprocal paths between substance abuse and violent behavior. There were statistically significant indirect paths from both traditional and cyberbullying victimization to suicide attempts without the involvement of depression, suicidal thinking, or suicide planning, findings suggesting a model for spontaneous, unplanned adolescent suicides. Results suggested that female adolescents who reported cyberbullying victimization also reported higher rates of depression and suicidal behaviors compared to their male counterparts, and that as adolescents got older, depression and substance abuse tended to increase, while violent behavior and suicidal thinking tended to decrease. The implications of these findings for social workers, school counselors, and others who work with adolescents are considered.}

   abstract = {Suicidal behavior is a major problem worldwide and, at the same time, has received relatively little empirical attention. This relative lack of empirical attention may be due in part to a relative absence of theory development regarding suicidal behavior. The current article presents the interpersonal theory of suicidal behavior. We propose that the most dangerous form of suicidal desire is caused by the simultaneous presence of two interpersonal constructs-thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness (and hopelessness about these states)-and further that the capability to engage in suicidal behavior is separate from the desire to engage in suicidal behavior. According to the theory, the capability for suicidal behavior emerges, via habituation and opponent processes, in response to repeated exposure to physically painful and/or fear-inducing experiences. In the current article, the theory's hypotheses are more precisely delineated than in previous presentations (Joiner, 2005), with the aim of inviting scientific inquiry and potential falsification of the theory's hypotheses.},

   abstract = {Over the past decade, the interpersonal theory of suicide has contributed to substantial advances in the scientific and clinical understanding of suicide and related conditions. The interpersonal theory of suicide posits that suicidal desire emerges when individuals experience intractable feelings of perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness and near-lethal or lethal suicidal behavior occurs in the presence of suicidal desire and capability for suicide. A growing number of studies have tested these posited pathways in various samples; however, these findings have yet to be evaluated meta-analytically. This paper aimed to (a) conduct a systematic review of the unpublished and published, peer-reviewed literature examining the relationship between interpersonal theory constructs and suicidal thoughts and behaviors, (b) conduct meta-analyses testing the interpersonal theory hypotheses, and (c) evaluate the influence of various moderators on these relationships. Four electronic bibliographic databases were searched through the end of March, 2016: PubMed, Medline, PsycINFO, and Web of Science. Hypothesis-driven meta-analyses using random effects models were conducted using 122 distinct unpublished and published samples. Findings supported the interpersonal theory: the interaction between thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness was significantly associated with suicidal ideation; and the interaction between thwarted belongingness, perceived burdensomeness, and capability for suicide was significantly related to a greater number of prior suicide attempts. However, effect sizes for these interactions were modest. Alternative configurations of theory variables were similarly useful for predicting suicide risk as theory-consistent pathways. We conclude with limitations and recommendations for the interpersonal theory as a framework for understanding the suicidal spectrum. (PsycINFO Database Record},

 abstract = {When making sampling distribution inferences about the parameter of the data, θ, it is appropriate to ignore the process that causes missing data if the missing data are `missing at random' and the observed data are `observed at random', but these inferences are generally conditional on the observed pattern of missing data. When making direct-likelihood or Bayesian inferences about θ, it is appropriate to ignore the process that causes missing data if the missing data are missing at random and the parameter of the missing data process is `distinct' from θ. These conditions are the weakest general conditions under which ignoring the process that causes missing data always leads to correct inferences.},
