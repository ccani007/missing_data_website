I recently graduated with a Ph.D. in Social Work and am currently working as a Postdoctoral Fellow at New York University [Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development](https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/) and the [Arcadia Suicide Center](https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/ihdsc/projects/arcadia). 

My research focuses on the **prevention of adolescent suicide attempts**. I am passionate about **data science** and **machine learning**, continually seeking to apply these tools to improve outcomes in my field.
